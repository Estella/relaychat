This is pretty new.

You need tcl to run this and optionally TLS for Tcl 1.6.7+ for TLS/SSL.

Edit chat.conf and then run:

   tclsh chat.tcl

Currently, just use the IRC gateway or simple chat client:

   Connect to localhost:6667 if you have the irc gateway enabled.

   Use: tclsh chatclient.tcl localhost 7654 <desired nickname> if you want to use
   the simple and quite awful chat client.

Protocol docs are in PROTOCOL.md
